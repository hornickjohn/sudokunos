# Sudokunos

## Description

This is a Windows Forms Application solution for an app I wrote around late 2017/early 2018 to generate a sudoku-like variant puzzle, in which the subsections are not square but procedurally generated shapes.

In addition to the client app having options to generate these puzzles, it can also present one for manual solving in a given interface. I used this and other code to generate puzzles and bitmaps of said puzzles to publish a puzzle book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Sudokunos-Fun-Variation-Classic-Sudoku/dp/1523890878/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XDHN36KWOXSQ&qid=1679438675&sprefix=sudokun%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1
